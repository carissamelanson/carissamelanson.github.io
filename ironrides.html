			<h3>Project Brief</h3>
			<p>This project will always hold a special place in my heart because it was my first hackathon project. I pitched an idea for a campus carpooling app and recruited a front end developer and a rails developer to help me create it in 72 hours! I wrote HTML in React and styled it in Sass.
			</p>
			<h3>Tools Used</h3>
			<p>HTML, Sass, Typekit, Responsive Web Design, Photoshop, Illustrator</p>
