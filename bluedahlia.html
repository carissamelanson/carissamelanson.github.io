						<h3>Project Brief</h3>
						<p>I love happy hours at Blue Dahlia! They have one of the best patios in town. Their current website doesn't reflect what a cool restaurant it is. My goal was to make the website more inviting and modern. I gathered research, made wordlists, sketches and wireframes.
