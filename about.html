            <p>I'm a Designer motivated by passion and driven by solving problems with design. I share a studio in East Austin with Charlie of <a href="http://charlesmelansonarchitect.com/">CJM Architecture</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
           Since my art school days at the University of Texas, I've worked across multiple disciplines: interiors, textiles, illustration, print, and web. I've created work for Bunkhouse, Reverb, Dell, and uShip.</p><br>

           <p>I enjoy the creative process and I'm always looking to add to my diverse skill set. I recently completed a 12 week immersive course on User Interface design and learned how to code static prototypes using HTML, CSS, and some javascript.</p>
