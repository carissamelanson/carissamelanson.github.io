                        <p>Born and raised in the Lone Star State and I'm currently based out of Austin, Texas. I have a BFA in Design form UT-Austin and have been a mural painter, a co-founder of a textile design studio, a screen printer on tour with Drake, an art mentor to children, and a graphic designer for political campaigns. As a recent graduate from The Iron Yard, I am excited to add to my skill set as a UI Designer.</p>

                        <p>
                            I have discovered that I gain the most fulfillment in connecting with people who share the same soul mentality. Being inspired, inspiring one another, and joining people together to create a full collaboration creates a rewarding experience where I produce some of my best work.
