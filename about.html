            <p>Born and raised in the Lone Star State, I share a studio in East Austin with Charlie from

            I studied design at the University of Texas at Austin where I met a group of talented people that I'm proud to call my friends. Since my art school days at UT, I started a screen printing textile studio with two amazing ladies, screen printed on tour with Drake, worked in interior design, and designed political campaigns. To add to my diverse skill set, I attended The Iron Yard where I studied User Interface design and learned how to code static prototypes.</p>

           Since my art school days at the University of Texas, I've worked across multiple disciplines: interiors, textiles, illustration, print, and web. I've created work for Bunkhouse, Reverb, Dell, and uShip.</p><br>

           <p>I enjoy the creative process and I'm always looking to add to my diverse skill set. I recently completed a 12 week immersive course on User Interface design and learned how to code static prototypes using HTML, CSS, and some javascript.</p>
