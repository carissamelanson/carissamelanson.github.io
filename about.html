            <p>Born and raised in the Lone Star State, I’m currently based out of Austin, Texas. I have a BFA in Design from UT - Austin and recently completed the UI Design program at The Iron Yard. I’ve spent most of my career working as a graphic designer and I’m excited to add UI/UX to my skill set. My art and design background has allowed me to work on various projects ranging from print, branding and digital experiences to painting murals, co-founding a textile design studio and screen printing on tour with Drake!</p>

                I gain the most fulfillment in connecting with people who share the same soul mentality. Being inspired, inspiring one another, and joining people together to create a full collaboration creates a rewarding experience where I produce some of my best work.
