                        <p>I was born and raised in the Lone Star State and I'm currently based out of Austin, Texas. I have been a mural painter, a co-founder of a textile design studio, a screen printer on tour with Drake, an art mentor to children, a graphic designer for political campaigns, now I'm currently a UI Design student at The Iron Yard.</p>

                        <p>
                            I have discovered that I gain the most fulfillment in connecting with people who share the same soul mentality. Being inspired, inspiring one another, and joining people together to create a full collaboration creates a rewarding experience where I produce some of my best work.
