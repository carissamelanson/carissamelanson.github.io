            <p>Born and raised in the Lone Star State, I'm currently based out of Austin, Texas. I have a BFA in Design from UT- Austin and recently completed the UI Design program at The Iron Yard. I've spent most of my career working as a graphic designer and I'm excited to add UI/UX to my skill set. My art and design background has allowed me to work on various projects ranging from print, branding and digital experiences to painting murals, co-founding a textile design studio and screen printing on tour with Drake!</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I gain the most fulfillment in connecting with people who share the same soul mentality. Being inspired, inspiring one another, and joining people together to create a full collaboration creates a rewarding experience where I produce some of my best work.
            </p>
            <!--       <br>
            <p>I'm currently looking for a full time position where I can  apply all of my talents and newly acquired UI design skills to use. If you're hiring or know a company that might be a good fit, please let me know!</p> -->
