            <p>Born and raised in the Lone Star State, I share a studio in East Austin with Charlie from
                <a href="http://charlesmelansonarchitect.com/">CJM Architecture</a>.</p>

            I studied design at the University of Texas at Austin where I met a group of talented people that I'm proud to call my friends. Since my art school days at UT, I started a screen printing textile studio with two amazing ladies, screen printed on tour with Drake, worked in interior design, and designed political campaigns. To add to my diverse skill set, I attended The Iron Yard where I studied User Interface design and learned how to code static prototypes.</p>

                I gain the most fulfillment in connecting with people who share the same soul mentality. Being inspired, inspiring one another, and joining people together to create a full collaboration creates a rewarding experience where I produce some of my best work.
