Last weekend I was fortunate to have the opportunity to hang out with most of my classmates from UT Design school, 11 out of 16. It's so crazy how time flies, it's been about 10 years since graduation and about 10 years since I saw some of my classmates in person. I've kept in touch with most of them and have followed them and all of their life moments that are posted online over the years.

<br>

I was able to contact most of them(the majority of them are still in Austin)and organize a meeting. We met over beers and it was fun! I was really impressed to hear all of their stories, most of them have made a career in design. Some are successfully working for themselves, others are Creative Directors, Music Video Directors, mothers, fathers. Being all together again, it seemed as if no time had passed. I guess that's what happens when you work closely with the same group of people all day, everyday for about 3 years.

<br>

I hope to make it a regular meeting and hopefully we'll get everyone to attend next time.
