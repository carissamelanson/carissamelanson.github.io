Week one was hard, but exciting. I definitely had a moment where I thought to myself, “Did I make the right decision to leave my job and throw myself into the unchartered and intimidating territory of coding?”
I've been happy with my decision so far—I'm learning something new every day. Sometimes information doesn't make sense right away, but it still feels good to be learning. 

The first weekend project was really challenging and after 16 hours of sitting at my desk coding a mockup, my body started to feel like it was morphing into my chair and my eyes probably didn't blink enough, but my general mood was happy.
