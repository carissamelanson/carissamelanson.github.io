I went to a Women Who Code meetup last night and met some inspiring 
women. There was a talk on CSS and pseudo selectors and I found myself
very interested! I understood what was being talked about and I even learned a new trick! Who would have known that I would find talks about CSS interesting outside of the classroom!
