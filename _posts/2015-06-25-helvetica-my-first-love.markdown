My love for the typeface started at a young age, I think I was in kindergarten.  
<br/> 
I liked seeing my name in Helvetica on forms and name tags and I repeatedly saw it throughout my school years. It became familiar.  
<br/>

In college I studied design and finally learned about the typeface. I realized I was attracted to the simplicity of it and the way the bowl of the lower case 'a' and spine of the letter 's' are so nicely curved and smooth.
I also realized that it was overused and then I was introduced to Futura.  
<br/>

I loved Futura for a long time. Again, I was attracted by the simplicity. 
I loved the geometrical shapes and designed my first letterhead with the typeface. Time passed and I was introduced to new typefaces and forgot about Futura for a while.  
<br/>

Currently, I like Gotham and Adobe Garamond.  
<br/>

Helvetica and Futura still hold a special place in my heart. It's like when you sometimes associate songs to certain moments in your life, I associate typefaces.
