Part of my job hunt involves a lot of networking. I've been going to meet ups
and meeting new people. I attended an Open Austin meetup earlier this month and in an effort to keep my skills sharp and gain experience working on real world projects I joined the Texas Appleseed project.

<br>

Texas Appleseed is working to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline and keep children in school and on track to graduate. The goal of the project is to create a website that provides practical resources, interactive maps, and data collection tools to students, parents, grassroots organizations, advocates, and school districts who want to make positive changes in their schools and communities.

My team is building the site in WordPress so that it can be easily updated and maintained in the future by the Texas Appleseed organization. I've been working on low fidelity mockups and icons for the site. Here's the first round of ideas for the icons. I'll continue to update on the progress of the site as we move forward.
