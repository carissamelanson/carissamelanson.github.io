One of the Rails students asked for some design help for their final project in Slack and I thought it would be a good chance to get more experience collaborating with a developer, so I responded!

My side project for the last couple of days has been researching different cheeses and looking at gamification apps. I created a style tile for the project with colors, typefaces and some icons that could be possibilities.
Eventhough I have a lot of work to do I really enjoy drawing icons, it's been fun creating icons in Illustrator.
