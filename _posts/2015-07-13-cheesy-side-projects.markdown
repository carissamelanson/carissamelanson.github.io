One of the Rails students asked for some design help for their final project in Slack and I thought it would be a good chance to get more experience collaborating with a developer, so I responded! I'm contributing my designs skills to Crack the Wheel, a cheese reviewing app!

My side project for the last couple of days has been researching different cheeses and looking at gamification apps. I created a style tile for the project with colors, typefaces and some icons that could be possibilities for the site.

Eventhough I have a lot of work to do with my current projects, it's been a nice break to draw icons of cheese in Illusrator. I've realized that I really enjoy drawing icons!
