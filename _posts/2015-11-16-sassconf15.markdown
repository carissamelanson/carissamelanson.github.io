I was fortunate to be able to volunteer at SassConf 2015. I'm relatively
new to Sass and wasn't really sure what to expect at the conference, but 
I'm so glad I was able to volunteer and attend! Everyone was really 
friendly and passionate about their work. It was awesome and inspiring
to be surrounded by talented designers and developers who are using technology for positive change. I hope to attend the conference next year!
