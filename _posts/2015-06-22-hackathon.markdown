I survived my first Hackathon! It was super challenging and really hard, but it was a great learning experience.
I pitched my idea for a carpooling app for the school and recruited some people to help me make it happen!  
<br>

There were some language barriers with both my front end developer and my rails developer which made communication a challenge, but also kind of funny for all of us.  
<br>

In 36 hours we were able to create a carpooling app that kind of worked. I was slightly disappointed, but I was also really proud of my team for everything that we accomplished.  
<br>

I hope to participate in more hackathons when the program ends.
