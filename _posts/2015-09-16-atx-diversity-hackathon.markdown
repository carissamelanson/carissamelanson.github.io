Over the weekend I participated in the ATX Diversity Hackathon organized by Women Who Code. This was my second hackathon and my first one outside of The Iron Yard. Although my team didn't produce a functioning app in the 20+ hours that we were together, we did create a solid concept, mockup and plan for the project to move forward.

My team created D1, a college readiness app designed to help student athletes navigate the college recruitment process. As a team we created a user persona and a user story to help us learn more about the app's targeted user and to help us narrow our focus for the weekend.

After we figured out who the app's target audience was, I explored colors, typography and icons that would appeal to high school student athletes. I created a style tile to present my design concept to the team. After agreeing on the look and tone for the site, I started working on low fidelity comps.
Once we figured out the content and copy for each page, I created pixel perfect mockups. One of my team mates introduced me to Marvel and we used Marvel to prototype our app.

Overall it was a good weekend of learning new things, meeting and working with new people and doing design!
