The design part of this program has made me realize that I've developed some bad habits in my design process. I've been making a an amateur move and I'm not proud of it.  
<br/>

When I start a project, I tend to run with the first idea that I can visualize in my head. I can hear my college design professor, Gloria Lee saying,"Don't get married to your designs!" I should be working out multiple ideas to find out what the best solution is.  
<br/>

My goal this week and with my next project is to work on my design process. I'm going to keep my mind open and explore multiple possibilities. I need to remind myself to research and sketch ALOT before jumping on the computer.
