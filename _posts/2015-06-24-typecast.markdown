We just started our website redesign project and we are using Typecast to layout fonts for our menus.  
<br/>
Typecast seems tricky, it's not really intuitive. It seems like it could be a really cool program to use for doing quick mockups, but it's not quick at all. It works kind of buggy. I keep deleting lines and looking for an undo option, but that doesn't seem to exist. Things seem to move on their own. Using Typecast took way longer and some of my layouts aren't a true representation of my concept, because of all the weird things going on in Typecast I felt kind of limited in what I could do with it. It seems like Illustrator might be a better option moving forward.
