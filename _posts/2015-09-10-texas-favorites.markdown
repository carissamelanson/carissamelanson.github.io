While at The Iron Yard, I was fortunate to participate in an icon workshop led by Ryan Weaver. During the workshop we created Austin/Texas inspired icons by using the pen tool and the pathfinder options in Illustrator. It was a fun exercise and it inspired me to continue drawing.

As a native Texan I love all things Texas! This drawing is two of my favorite summer things. Shiner's Ruby Redbird beer and beef ribs.
