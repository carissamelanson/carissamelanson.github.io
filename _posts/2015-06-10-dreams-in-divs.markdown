During the Friday huddle, I was chosen to talk about what my class was learning. I hate feeling unprepared and I could feel anxiety forming in my chest, but I presented. And it was fine. Note to self: practice public speaking. It was also my birthday and the entire room sang, “Happy Birthday” to me. I definitely felt a sense of community.

Writing HTML and CSS is starting to make some sense. I'm starting to get used to the terminology. Divs have been creeping into my subconscious. One night I closed a div after a dream and opened a div for another dream. So weird.
