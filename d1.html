			<h3>Project Brief</h3>
			<p>D1 is a college readiness app designed to help student athletes navigate the college recruitment process. My team explored and refined the concept for this project during the ATX Diversity Hackathon. I collaborated with developers to create pixel perfect mockups for the app and used Marvel to prototype it.

			<h3>Tools Used</h3>
			<p>Sketching, Prototyping, Illustrator, Marvel</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>After refining the concept, we created user personas and user stories to gain insight about the app's target audience. I created a style tile to explore colors and typography to create a look and feel for the app that would connect with student athletes.</p>
