			<h3>Project Brief</h3>
			<p>This was a redesign and rebranding project. The client was considering changing the name of their company by adding another partner's name. They wanted a clean logo with a familiar element from their original logo.
			</p>
			<h3>Tools Used</h3>
			<p>Sketching, Illustrator, Photoshop</p>
			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>After doing a competitive market analysis, I sketched hundreds of ideas and refined a few concepts in Illustrator. I approached the redesign by keeping the gold color from their original logo and adding a complimentary navy with the goal being to create a visual representation of adding a partner while keeping an original element to keep the new logo familiar.</p>
